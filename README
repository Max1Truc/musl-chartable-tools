musl chartable-tools
====================

This repository contains (slightly cleaned up versions of) the source
files used to generate musl libc's iconv and ctype/wcwidth tables. The
code is still highly unpolished and unsafe to run on untrusted data.

Both sets of tools (iconv and ctype) include makefiles that build and
run them to produce the tables. The initial check-in has been checked
to match the table contents (but not the exact formatting) present in
musl 1.1.18.
